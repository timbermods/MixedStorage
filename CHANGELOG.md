# Changelog

## v1.2.1

The storage panel keeps what's stored in view. Saves and co-op work with v1.2.0; co-op players should still update together.

- The summary line and the goods cards now stay at the top of the Storage Allocation panel while you scroll the goods list. The cards show two goods at a time; with more goods allocated or stored, scroll the cards themselves.

## v1.2.0

Two panel improvements. **All co-op players must update together**: earlier versions refuse an Apply that stores nothing. Saves load both ways with v1.1.x.

- Set every good to 0% (for example with Clear all) and click **Apply: store nothing** to make a warehouse or pile store nothing, like a newly built one. Before, Apply stayed unavailable unless the total was 100%. Stock already there is kept and can be hauled out. Like any lowered limit, it waits for deliveries already on their way.
- While your draft differs from the building's current settings, the Apply button has an orange ring and bold text, so a waiting change is visible even when the message under the goods list is scrolled out of view.

## v1.1.1

Two fixes from the v1.1.0 reviews. Saves load both ways with v1.1.0; co-op players should update together.

- A saved allocation that still names a good from a removed mod no longer throws an error when the building leaves mixed storage. Only goods the building accepts are announced to the game.
- In the map editor, an undo that removes a building's allocation now updates the game's hauling caches and the building's visuals right away, instead of leaving the old limits cached and switching off the mixed visuals for that building.

## v1.1.0

Fixes and checks from a review of v1.0.0. **All co-op players must update together.** Saves load both ways with v1.0.0.

- Copy Settings from a building set to store nothing, such as one just built, now keeps a mixed building's allocation, so copying the storage mode from a new building no longer wipes it. To turn a mixed building back into a normal one, give another building a single good in the goods dropdown of the game's building list and copy from that.
- Copy Settings no longer turns a mixed building back into a normal one while a delivery already on its way would no longer fit. The building stays mixed and Player.log says why, as for a copied mixed allocation. Its other copied settings, such as the storage mode, still apply.
- The storage panel explains why Apply is unavailable when a saved allocation includes a good the building no longer accepts: those goods are marked "(not accepted here)" and the total reads "Set unavailable goods to 0% before applying".
- Mixed storage in Supply mode no longer searches the district for goods it holds none of. Haulers still pick the same goods as before.
- MixedStorage's patches that replace a game method now run after other mods' patches on that method, so every co-op player runs them in the same order. BeaverBuddies' goods-dropdown events on a mixed building now always reach MixedStorage's refusal on replay instead of sometimes being dropped locally.
- If a game update removes the method MixedStorage uses to tell the game that a good's limit changed, the game still starts. Player.log says why, existing allocations keep working, and Apply and Copy Settings that would change an allocation are refused with that reason instead of failing partway through.
- Website: the download buttons offer GitHub's Latest release and always the MixedStorage zip, never another file attached to the release.
- Development: the version is set once, in Directory.Build.props. The build checks every Harmony patch target, injected field and reflected game member against the installed game, the two patch names LateGamePerformance trusts, and that the replayed Copy Settings path reads only shared simulation state. GitHub Actions runs the allocation, website and version checks on every pull request.

## v1.0.0

First official release. Everything from v0.5.8, plus fixes from a code review before release.

- The game's Duplicate settings tool now works both ways. Copying from a mixed building still copies its percentages, and a target that cannot take them is left as it was. Copying from a normal building, or one set to store nothing, now turns a mixed building back into a normal one; before, the mixed allocation silently stayed. This is also the way to leave mixed storage.
- Package the download so it extracts correctly on macOS and Linux. Earlier zips used Windows-only `\` folder separators.
- If the installed BeaverBuddies is a build MixedStorage cannot work with, say what is missing in Player.log at startup and refuse multiplayer Apply with that reason, instead of Apply silently doing nothing. The game still starts. Any other Apply error is shown in the panel.
- A damaged saved allocation no longer stops the whole save from loading; that building keeps its normal single good and the log says what was skipped.
- The building list says "Mixed (1 good)". Remove the unused v0.4 triangle clipper. README covers removing the mod and notes that the mod's own text is English-only.

## v0.5.8

- Keep the dev-mode (cheats) panel fully visible below the allocation editor, so its buttons, such as "Finish now" on an unfinished building, are no longer pushed off the bottom of the screen. The editor already left room for the Construction site panel; it now leaves room for the dev-mode panel as well. Layout is unchanged when dev mode is off.

## v0.5.7

- Cheaper mixed-storage visuals. A delivery now redraws only the goods whose stock changed instead of every good in the building, reuses lookups and geometry buffers instead of reallocating them each time, and holds off redrawing buildings the camera cannot see until they come back into view. How storage looks is otherwise unchanged.

## v0.5.6

- Tighten the search row: the search box now starts right after the Search label and fills the rest of the row, removing the empty gap. Layout is otherwise unchanged.

## v0.5.5

- Keep the native Construction site panel fully visible below the allocation editor while a warehouse or pile is being built. The editor now leaves room for any fragments Timberborn stacks beneath it and grows back when construction finishes. Layout is otherwise unchanged.

## v0.5.4

- Keep Copy allocations and Paste allocations fixed above the allocation total so both remain visible at every scroll position. Preserve the existing native styling and allocation behavior.

## v0.5.3

- Align the entire selected storage window to one width, including the native title, description, hauling controls, and allocation editor. Restore the original width when selecting another type of building or closing the window.
- Reuse Timberborn's native textured panel frames, buttons, input fields, checkbox, scrollbar, text colors, and stock-bar colors.
- Preserve the summary cards, compact goods rows, screen-height cap, and fixed allocation total / Apply / Revert footer. Allocation and multiplayer behavior are unchanged.

## v0.5.2

- Use a single scrolling body, removing stacked scrollbar gutters from the summary and goods list.
- Align percentage controls and limits with their headers; wrap the capacity summary and reduce horizontal padding.
- Widen the editor to 440 UI units, bounded by the viewport, expanding left from the sidebar edge. Preserve the fixed Apply/Revert/total footer and screen-height cap.

## v0.5.1

- Bound the allocation panel to available screen height and scroll its content independently.
- Keep allocation totals and Apply/Clear/Revert controls outside the scrolling body.

## v0.5.0

- One MixedStorage download and mod entry for single-player and multiplayer.
- Embed the optional BeaverBuddies bridge and activate it only when BeaverBuddies is loaded.
- Reject the obsolete separate addon with clear upgrade instructions. Preserve allocation save keys.
- Add isolated loading tests with and without BeaverBuddies and legacy-addon detection.

## v0.4.3

- Replace triangle clipping with complete native cell selection at allocation boundaries.
- Validate primary/secondary mesh topology before selecting cells. Fit continuous or unrecognized meshes into their sections without cutting faces.
- Keep exact gameplay limits; visual proportions approximate whole cells. Add partition and topology regression checks.

## v0.4.2

- Replace the small inline contents summary with readable cards: 30px goods icons, bold names, 19px stored/limit counts, allocation percentages and stock fill bars.
- Keep incoming and excess counts visible, and bound the summary height for large goods lists.

## v0.4.1 (visual prototype fix)

- Fix ambiguous native method lookup that caused mixed visuals to fall back to one good.
- Resolve rendering methods by their argument types and validate nine native API signatures against the installed game assemblies.
- Include full exception details in rendering fallback warnings.

## v0.4.0 (visual prototype)

- Divide native goods meshes into deterministic allocation-sized sections, filling each from its actual stock.
- Preserve native materials and icons, with lifecycle cleanup and native visual fallback.
- Coalesce visual updates to at most five rebuilds per building per second.
- Add offline mesh-clipping tests. In-game appearance and performance remain unverified.

## v0.3.1

- Add a live top summary of applied percentages, stored quantities and limits for all allocated or stocked goods.
- Include incoming deliveries and excess stock, independently of search and filters.

## v0.3.0

- Add per-good Max buttons to assign 100% with one click.
- Add Copy allocations and Paste allocations between compatible storage buildings.
- Preserve exact percentages and recalculate limits for each destination capacity.
- Reject incompatible pastes atomically; apply changes through the existing multiplayer event path.

## v0.2.0

- Use MixedStorage naming throughout the mod, multiplayer addon, assemblies, IDs, UI identifiers and allocation save data.
- Add Folktails small, large and underground piles.
- Add Iron Teeth small and large industrial piles.
- Preserve each storage building's native accepted goods and capacity.
- Extend existing allocation persistence, delivery reservations and multiplayer replay events to piles.
- Rename the editor heading to Storage Allocation.

## v0.1.1

- Add a reset button beside each percentage and a clear-search button.
- Compact rows without reducing goods-name or stock-count text sizes.
- Block gameplay shortcuts while editing allocation or search text.
- Add visible styling to inputs and buttons.

## v0.1.0

- Add configurable mixed storage for small, medium and large warehouses.
- Require allocations to sum to exactly 100%, with 0.01% precision.
- Add search, allocated-only filtering and whole-item capacity previews.
- Preserve allocations in saves and support mixed-good Obtain and Supply modes.
- Add the optional BeaverBuddies synchronization addon.
